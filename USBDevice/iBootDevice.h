/**
 This class implements DFU file transfer for iBoot devices. These devices include
 the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.
 
 iBootDevice is used as an example to show off the powers of the USBDeviceFramework application
 framework.
 
 You should be able to handle parsing the serial number of the device as returned by `-deviceSerialNumber`
 very easily to create an application specific to a target device type (i.e: CPID, CPRV, CPFM, SCEP, etc).
 Currently, the iBootDevice API does not do this. You are free to implement it however.
